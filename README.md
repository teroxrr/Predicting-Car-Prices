# Predicting Car Prices Using K-Nearest NeighborsÂ¶
This project offers a description of how the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm works. We will apply it to a real world dataset, after performing some cleaning.
The main goal is to get a grasp of how we can train a model, improve its functioning through the development of certain tools, and use it to make predictions.

* To read the analysis open [K_Nearest_Neighbor_Basics.ipynb](K_Nearest_Neighbor_Basics.ipynb)

### Required Libraries
The project is written in Python, using the following tools:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
